May 16, 2022 Request for Extension of Time. 2Freeport LNG Development, L.P. , 167 FERC ¶ 61,155 (2019) (Authorization Order) . 3Id.at 3-4. The existing Freeport LNG Terminal includes three liquefaction trains for the export of up to 2.14 Bcf per day of LNG, equivalent to 15.49 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG , which are currently in service . Id.at 3. The Train 4 Projec t is an additional 5.1 -mtpa liquefaction train expansion of the previously authorized Liquefaction Project, with an identical design to Freeport LNG’s other three liquefaction trains. Id.at 4.  Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -2 - On September 10, 2020 , Commission staff issued a letter order granting Freeport LNG an extension of time, until May 17, 2026 ,to complete the Train 4 Project.4 On May 16, 2022, F reeport LNG filed a request for a second extension of time for the Train 4 Project, until August 1, 2028.5 Freeport LNG notes that construction of the Train 4 Project has not yet commenced, and cites delays stemming from the replacement of its engineering, procurement, and construction contractor and the COVID -19 pandemic, including the pandemic’s effects on the global supply -chain and the impacts on global LNG demand.6Freeport LNG states that demand for LNG has rebounded, and it has been actively negotiating with potential off -take customers.7 Freeport LNG anticipates a minimum 48 -56 month construction period, which makes it impossible for Freeport LNG to meet its current deadline of May 17, 2026.8 II. Notice , Intervention, and Protests Notice of F reeport LNG’s Extension of Time Request was issued on May 23, 2022 , and published in the Federal Register on May 27, 2022.9 The notice established June 7, 2022 ,as the deadline for filing interventions, comments, and protests. Public Citizen filed a timely motion to intervene, and the Sierra Club filed a timely motion to 4Freeport LNG Development, L.P. & FLNG Liquefaction 4, LLC , Docket No. CP17 -470-000 (Sept. 10, 2020) (delegated order) (Letter Order Granting Extension of Time). Freeport LNG cited difficulties in completing long -term contracts with potential customers due to the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic as a main reaso n for the extension request.

FLNG explains that certain ty regarding its ability to complete construction prior to the in -service deadline is essential to completing commercialization of the project, which is why FLNG is filing now, rather than closer to the expiration of its current authorization. Id. FLNG s tates that the unique nature of financing LNG projects and the upfront, long -term commercial commitments required of LNG off -takers necessitates advance certainty of the ability to timely complete construction. Id. 9Notice of Request for Extension of Tim e, 87 Fed. Reg . 32,154 (May 27, 2022). Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -3 - intervene and protest . Timely, unopposed motions to intervene are granted by operation of Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure.10 Sierra Club opposes granting the extension of time, arguing: (1) F reeport LNG has not demonstrated good cause for an extension; and (2) the Commission mus t revisit its environmental findings and supplement its NEPA analysis. In arguing for a reopening of the Commission’s environmental analysis, Sierra Club encourages the Commission to reconsider its prior finding that the project is not inconsistent with t he public interest due to changed circumstances in the global energy market . On June 22, 2022, F reeport LNG filed a n answer to Sierra Club’s protest.11 Freeport LNG states that it has demonstrated good cause and the Commission should not reconsider its p ublic interest or environmental findings. Pursuant to Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,12answers to protests are prohibited unless otherwise ordered by the decisional authority. We accept the company’s answer as it provi des information that will assist us in our decision -making process. III. Discussion The completion date specified in a certificate or authorization order provides what the Commission believes —based on the applicant’s initial project schedule and the Commissio n’s assessment of circumstances relevant to the specific project —to be a reasonable period of time for the project sponsor to complete construction and make the project available for service.13 However, construction deadlines may be extended for good cause .14 Good cause can be shown by a project sponsor demonstrating that it made 1018 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2021). 11Freeport LNG Development, L.P., June 22, 2022 Answer. 1218 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2) (2021); see also Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC , 170 FERC ¶ 61,144, at P 39 (2020) ( barringboth reply comments and answers in extension of time proceedings ). 13Constitution Pipeline Co., LLC , 165 FERC ¶ 61,081, at P 9 (2018) (citing Arlington Storage Co., LLC , 155 FERC ¶ 61,165, at P 8 (2016)). 1418 C.F.R. § 385.2008(a) (2021) (allowing the rel evant decisional authority to extend for good cause the time by which any person is required or allowed to act under any statute rule or order) . Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -4 - good faith efforts to meet its deadline but encountered circumstances that prevented it from doing so.15 A. Good Cause for Granting an Extension of Tim e Sierra Club argues F reeport LNG failed to demonstrate good cause for granting an extension of time.16Sierra Club argues that F reeport LNG’s present situation is dissimilar to prior instances when the Commission granted extensions of time to companies who were prevented from meeting deadlines due to the failure to obtain essential permits.17 It states that F reeport LNG’s failure to promptly replace its engineering, procurement, and construction contractor should convince the Commission that F reeport LNG has not demonstrated good cause.18Sierra Club also notes that the change in market conditions that made it difficult for F reeport LNG to enter into long term offtake contracts did not affect F reeport LNG’s ability to construct, but rather only affected the wisdom of proceeding.19 Sierra Club argues that F reeport LNG’s response to market conditions is tantamount to sitting on the authorization and waiting for conditions to improve, analogous to the situation in Chestnut Ridge Storage .20Finally, Sierra Club argues that F reeport LNG has not sufficiently demonstrated how the COVID -19 pandemic has impacted its ability to meet the prior deadline.21 Freeport LNG states that the COVID -19 pandemic has created persistent effects on global supply chains and the financing of large -scale infrast ructure projects.22 Further, Freeport LNG states the COVID -19 pandemic’s impact on demand made it difficult to 15See, e.g. , Adelphia Gatew ay, LLC , 178 FERC ¶ 61,030, at P 15 (2022). 16Sierra Club June 7, 2022 Motion to Int ervene and Comments at 4. 17Id.at 4-5. 18Id. at 5. 19Id.at 6. 20Id. (citing Chestnut Ridge Storage, LLC , 139 FERC ¶ 61,149, at P 13 (2012)) Sierra Club argues that Commission should follow Chestnut Ridge Storage and decline to find good cause for an extension when an applicant could take steps to proceed but chooses not to do so because of market conditions.

Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -5 - secure long -term LNG commitments.23 However, F reeport LNG states that while the pandemic’s impact on supply chains remains, the pandemic’s impact on the global LNG market has waned and F reeport LNG is currently in negotiations with several potential offtake customers.24 Freeport LNG explains that it has obtained and is maintaining all required permits . Freeport LNG also states that although it had executed an engineering, procurement, and construction contract with KBR, Inc., after conducting a year -long competitive bidding and bid evaluation process, it is now in the process of selecting a new engineering, procurement, and construction contractor due to KBR’s decision to exit the LNG business .25 In its answer, F reeport LNG reiterates that it has made diligent efforts to meet its in-service deadline by actively marketing the project’s capacity and faced unprecedented effects from the COVID -19 pand emic that significantly impacted all sectors of the global economy.26 Freeport LNG emphasizes that the LNG market is stabilizing and that its situation is readily distinguishable from the circumstances in Chestnut Ridge where the Commission declined to gra nt an extension because it has been actively pursuing project development.27 Freeport LNG also highlights the challenges of replacing an engineering, procurement, and construction contractor in normal times, without regard to the logistical hurdles posed b y the uncertainty of the then-nascent COVID -19 pandemic.28 As stated above, the Commission will find good cause exists for an extension of time where the certificate holder makes a good faith effort to complete authorized actions within the time allotted bu t encountered circumstances that prevent it from doing so. The Commission has previously found good cause exists for an extension of time where an authorization holder requested more time to secure contracts with potential customers , in 23Id. 24Id. at 1-2. 25Id. at 2-3. 26Freeport LNG Development, L.P., June 22, 2022 Answer at 4 -5. 27Id. at 6. 28Id.at 6-7. Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -6 - particular where t he COVID pandemic causes market disruptions .29 We consider extension requests on a case -by-case basis.30 We find that good cause exists for an extension and that Freeport LNG has made a good faith effort at meeting the deadline in its authorization. Th e Commission order authorizing Freeport LNG to construct and operate its LNG Terminal issued in May 2019, less than a year before the global COVID pandemic. Given the unforeseeable difficulties associated with the COVID pandemic, which as Freeport LNG explains caused major disruptions due to global lock -downs and logistical hurdles,31we disagree with Sierra Club’s assertion that Freeport LNG’s failure, to date, to have replaced its engineering, procurement, and construction contractor and commence const ruction of its project is evidence that Freeport LNG has not taken “all reasonable, good -faith efforts to meet its deadlines.”32 Unlike the applicant in Chestnut Ridge Storage , Freeport LNG is not “ sitting on its approval while waiting to see whether marke t conditions become favorable .”33 Instead, during the time since it received its authorization , Freeport LNG has, among other things, maintained its permits for the project, actively pursued commercial agreements ,and is actively pursuing a new engineering , procurement, and 29See, e.g. , Trunkline Gas Co., LLC , 179 FERC ¶ 61,086, at P 21 (2022) (finding good cause for a three -year extension of time where companies faced difficulties due to the COVID -19 pandemic yet demonstrated a continued commitment to the project); Corpus Christi LNG Stage III, LLC , 179 FERC ¶ 61,087, at P 13 (2022) (finding good cause for a 31 -month extension of time where companies cited unforeseeable impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic as reason for an extension); Delfin LNG LLC , 178 FERC ¶61,031, at PP 21 -23 (2022) (granting an extension of time to construct the onshore portions of a non -jurisdictional LNG export terminal in light of the applicant’s continued efforts to negotiate and secure long -term contracts with prospective customers ). 30Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co., LLC , 175 FERC ¶ 61,148 at P 8 . 31Freeport LNG Development, L.P.

In Chestnut Ridge , the Commission denied an extension request because the company made no attempt to dispute thatthe certificated storage project was not financially viable.

Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -7 - construction contractor (after the unanticipated withdrawal of its previous contractor) , all of which we find evidence continued commitment to proceeding with the project.34 B. The Authorization Order’s Environmental Analysis Remains Valid Sierra Club argues that the decision to grant an extension of time is a major Federal action with the potential to significantly affect the environment and the Commission must therefore revisit its environmental review under the National Environmental Polic y Act (NEPA).35 Sierra Club also argues, in the alternative, that the Commission must supplement its NEPA review in light of changed circumstances , specifically, the listing of the Rice’s whale under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).36 Sierra Club also not es that the Commission’s Authorization Order did not consider Freeport LNG’s publicly announced plans to develop a carbon capture and sequestration project, which calls into question whether the Commission properly considered whether a project without such measures is in the public interest.37 We do not agree that granting an extension of time is a major Federal action requiring additional review under NEPA. NEPA requires a supplemental EIS when a major Federal action remains to occur and the agency makes s ubstantial changes to the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.38 Approval of a request fo r extension of time is an administrative action and is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.39 Granting an extension of time to complete an approved 34See,e.g.Trunkline Gas Co., LLC , 179 FERC ¶ 61,086 at P 21 (finding good cause for a three -year extension of time where companies faced difficulties due to the COVID -19 pandemic yet demonstrated a commitment to the project); Corpus Christi LNG Stage III, LLC , 179 FERC ¶ 61,087 at P 13 (fi nding good cause for a 31 -month extension of time where companies cited unforeseeable impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic as reason for an extension). 35Sierra Club June 7, 2022 Motion to Intervene and Comments at 7. 36Id.at 8. 37Id. at 9. 3840 C.F.R. § 1502.9(d)(1) (2021). 39See, e.g. , Trunkline Gas Co., LLC , 179 FERC ¶ 61,086 at PP 16 -17;Adelphia Gatew ay LLC , 178 FERC ¶ 61,030 at P 23; see also Eagle Crest Energy Co. , 168 FERC ¶ 61,186, at P 22 (2019) (holding that an extension of time to comply with a license requirement to commence and complete construction by a certain date, that involves no  Docket No. CP17 -470-002 -8 - action constitute s neither a substantial change nor a ne w approval of the specific proposed project in question.40 Moreover, there has been no showing that the environmental effects of the project have changed since the issuance of the Authorization Order .41 Nor is this the appropriate proceeding to consider th e impacts of a nypotential carbon capture and sequestration project. We agree that the information regarding newly listed threatened and endangered species requires consideration and that the ESA regulations42require a determination whether the project ma y have impacts on the newly listed species.43 Specifically, i f a new species is listed after the Commission’s issuance of a certificate and before the completion of project construction, Commission staff will determine whether the project may affect the sp ecies. If the project will not affect the species, the Commission has no further ESA obligation . If the Commission determines that the project “may affect” the species,44then the Commission must consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service or the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service , as appropriate . However, the potential need to re -initiate consultation on newly listed species does not in and of itself render the environmental analysis stale or trigger the need for construction or changes to the project development, is an administrative action appropriately categorically excluded from further NEPA review), aff’d sub nom .

We note that, should it become necessary based on ESA consultation with the Services, the Commission will determine whether it should, consistent with 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(d)(1), supplement its environmental review under NEP A prior to authorizing the companies to commence construction of the Train 4 Project . Because we find that Freeport LNG Development, L.P. and FLNG Liquefaction 4, LLC have demonstrated good cause for the delay and that the Authorization Order’s environment al findings remain valid , we will grant the request for a 26 -month extension to complete the construction of the project. The Commission on its own motion received and made a part of the record in this proceeding all evidence, including the motion and ex hibits thereto, and upon consideration of the record, The Commission orders : Freeport LNG Development, L.P. and FLNG Liquefaction 4, LLC are granted a 26-month extension of time, to August 1, 2028, to construct and make available for service the Train 4 P roject facilities authorized in CP17 -470-000.

O ur inquiry when reviewing a request for extension of time is narrow —it is not an opportunity to revisit the determinations made in Natural Gas Act authorizations after orders have become final and unappealable.4 There is thus no question of whether the public interest determination made in the Authorization Order remains valid.
